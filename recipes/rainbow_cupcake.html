      <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>½ cup milk</li>
      <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>½ cup butter</li>
      <li>3 large eggs, room temperature</li>
      <li>red food coloring</li>
      <li>blue food coloring</li>
      <li>green food coloring</li>
      <li>yellow food coloring</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two 12-cup
        muffin pans with paper baking cups.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large
        bowl. Whisk together milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla in a separate bowl
        until evenly blended; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light
        and fluffy. The mixture should be noticeably lighter in color. Add eggs
        one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the butter mixture before
        adding the next. Pour in the flour mixture alternately with the milk
        mixture, mixing until just incorporated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide cake batter into four separate bowls. Add a few drops of food
        coloring into one bowl of batter and stir; add more food coloring if
        necessary to reach the desired shade. Repeat with remaining colors and
        bowls of batter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a different spoon for each color batter, spoon a small portion of
        each color into the cupcake liners, until 1/2 to 3/4 full. Do not mix
        the batter once it is in the cupcake liner.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into a cupcake
        comes clean, 15 to 20 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
